            <h1>Body Mass Index Calculator</h1>

            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
            body mass index (BMI) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
            of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
            your overall health and well-being.

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
          healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
          such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
          fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
          strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
          five days a week.

        <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>

        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
        every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
        certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <img src="assets/images/pattern-curved-line-right.svg" alt="">

          <img src="assets/images/icon-gender.svg" alt="">
          <h4>Gender</h4>
        </div>
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
        a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
      </div>

      <div class="card item">
        <div class="icon-heading">
          <img src="assets/images/icon-age.svg" alt="">
          <h4>Age</h4>
        </div>
        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
        body fat content.
      </div>

      <div class="card item">
        <div class="icon-heading">
          <img src="assets/images/icon-muscle.svg" alt="">
          <h4>Muscle</h4>
        </div>
        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
        differentiate muscle from fat.
      </div>

      <div class="card item">
        <div class="icon-heading">
          <img src="assets/images/icon-pregnancy.svg" alt="">
          <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
        </div>
        Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
        healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
        and child.
      </div>

      <div class="card item">
        <div class="icon-heading">
          <img src="assets/images/icon-race.svg" alt="">
          <h4>Race</h4>
        </div>
        Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
        lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
        GP or practice nurse.
